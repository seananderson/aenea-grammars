# Grammars for Aenea / Dragonfly

Grammars for use with [Aenea](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea) /
[Dragonfly](https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly).

These are the configuration files that I use to code and edit text entirely
by voice. The bulk of my attention so far has been on developing a Vim
grammar.

This is a work in progress and unlikely to work on your system
without considerable modification. I work with my
[fork of Aenea](https://github.com/seananderson/aenea).

I have borrowed concepts and pieces of code from the following:

- <https://github.com/dwks/aenea-grammar-simple>
- <https://github.com/tgrosinger/aenea-grammars>
- <https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly-scripts>
- <https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea-grammars>
- <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI>
- <https://github.com/VoiceCode/docs/wiki>

Thanks for everyone's hard work that has made this possible.
