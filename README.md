# Grammars for Aenea / Dragonfly

Grammars for use with [Aenea](https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea) /
[Dragonfly](https://github.com/t4ngo/dragonfly).

These are the configuration files that I used to code and edit text entirely
by voice. The bulk of my attention so far has been on developing a Vim
grammar.

This is a work in progress and unlikely to work on your system
without considerable modification.

Concepts and bits of code were primarily borrowed from the following:

- <https://github.com/dwks/aenea-grammar-simple>
- <https://github.com/tgrosinger/aenea-grammars>
- <https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/dragonfly-scripts>
- <https://github.com/dictation-toolbox/aenea-grammars>

Thanks for everyone's hard work that has made this possible.
